# Add environmental variables to this file in yaml format:
#
# development: 
#   USERNAME: "cat"
#   PASSWORD: "secret"
#
# production:
#   USERNAME: "dog"
#   PASSWORD: "stillsecret"
#
# API_KEY: "ABCXYZ"
# SECRET: "HELLO"
#
# Envious supports Rails environments so anything under production will only be loaded into the environment in production, and anything under development will only be loaded in the development environment.
# Anything outside of an environment will be loaded no matter which Rails environment you're in.
